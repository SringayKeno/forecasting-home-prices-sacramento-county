#### Forecasting Home Prices in Sacramento County California (years 2023-2025) using Sarima forecasting method. SARIMA or  seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, is an extension of ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) that explicitly supports univariate time series data with a seasonal component. 

#### For more information regarding SARIMA I suggest a visit to Jason Brownlee's [A Gentle Introduction to SARIMA for Time Series Forecasting in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/sarima-for-time-series-forecasting-in-python/)

### Resources
#### * Data Source: Data sourced from Zillow's research data page. I used [Zillow's Home Value Index (ZHVI)](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) which is a  smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range.
